# House-price-prediction
This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline that predicts California housing prices using regression models and deploys the solution through an interactive Streamlit web application.

The objective of this project is to build a robust regression model capable of predicting house prices based on demographic, geographic, and economic features. The model is trained using structured tabular data and deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
